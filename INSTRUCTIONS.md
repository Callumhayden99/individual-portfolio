Planning & Inspiration:

Whilst planning my design for the portfolio, I realised early on I wanted it to be pretty simple, but also very clean at the same time, so I didnt want the page to be over crowded or unnecessary content. I just wanted to keep the same theme running through the portfolio with just a few colour's used. Whilst looking for inspiration, I came across a website that contained load's of different types of portfolio's, here's the web link:https://www.hostinger.co.uk/tutorials/web-developer-portfolio#1_Charles_Bruyerre. I came across one portfolio that caught my eye, it was number 2 on the page and they kept it very clean and simple, but with a few added animation's to it. Once i get a better understanding i'll probably go down the same route and try add some into my portfolio. 


Tech stack:

Ive only used the one's ive been currently taught whilst being on the course, which are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and REACT, whilst using the code editor VS CODE.
